Editing these documents
-----------------------

These document are developed using [ReSpec][respec] which now handles [Markdown syntax][md]. The only thing you need to get start is a browser and a text editor. Make your changes to any html file and drag it into a browser, ReSpec will compile it into a properly formatted doc on the fly.

### Using GitHub

Please do not commit directly to the main repository _even if you have commit rights_.

Instead, please fork the repository to your own GitHub account and commit your changes there. It's best to create a new branch per feature. Please send well scoped [pull requests][pr] to the main repository.

Please note that the main branch is `gh-pages`, as this allows automatically publishing the document on GitHub pages as described in [Using GitHub for Spec Work][specs-on-github].
